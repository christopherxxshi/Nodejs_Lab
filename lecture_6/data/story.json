    "story": "This summer, a friend of mine, an ever-loyal fan of Harry Potter, gave me a brand-new copy of the first book of the series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” I remember sitting there, doubting the excitement of what lay between the covers. I really thought that the Hogwarts Express had left the station, and I was too late in the Harry Potter craze (except for the massive swell that comes back around every Halloween). Quite frankly, it felt a bit pointless to try and read the whole series now. Obviously, here I am now, on the third book, loving every word. There’s a reason these books did so well.\nJ.K. Rowling’s power as an author is mystical. Her ability to put so much thought into the narrative processes of the Harry Potter series amazes me. A common quip I remember having as a kid reading fictional series was always the fact that no matter how good a book’s narrative was if it had stood alone, the author always felt they had to involve the characters in some sort of love/crush storyline that always served as the basis or motivation for their actions (I’m looking at you, “Percy Jackson,” “Hunger Games” and “Divergent”). And yes, I know that romance is imminent in Harry Potter as well, but I appreciate the fact that I’m three books in and awkward adolescent love doesn’t seem to be a driving force in the books’ narratives. Instead, Rowling emphasizes friendship, which never loses value, no matter if you’re a child or an adult.\n"
